JaLeCoN is a Dataset of **Ja**panese **Le**xical **Co**mplexity for **N**on-Native Readers. It can be used to train or evaluate Japanese lexical complexity prediction models.

Please cite the following paper in publications using this dataset. You can also refer to it for details about the data and a baseline experiment.

## Overview

`ck.txt`, `non_ck.txt`
- These files contain data for each L1 group. See also [Data Format](#data-format) below.

`cv_splits.json`
- This file contains cross-validation splits. See also [Cross-Validation Splits](#cross-validation-splits) below.

`mwe_list`
- This directory contains manually collected lists of MWEs, `mwe.tsv` and `proper_mwe.tsv`, where the latter contains proper noun phrases. Sequences of SUWs that match any MWEs in the lists are chunked in the step of MWE annotation (see Section 3.3 of the paper). `|` in the MWEs denote a boundary between SUWs.

## Data Format

The files `(ck|non_ck)/(news|gov).txt` are composed of sentences, each of which has the following format (terminated by a blank line):

```
<ID>\t<sentence_num>\t<sentence>
<word_1>
[…]
<word_n>

```

Example:
```
news-1-1	1	ネット|情報|から|危機|発生|を|瞬時|に|検知|、|デマ|も|判定|（|JBpress|）|-|Yahoo|!|ニュース
ネット	0:1	-	7	0	0	0	0.0
情報	1:2	-	6	1	0	0	0.047
[…]
-	16:17	-	7	0	0	0	0.0
Yahoo!ニュース	17:20	P	-	-	-	-	-

```

The first line is in the format `<ID>\t<sentence_num>\t<sentence>`:

- `ID` is the unique ID of the sentence in the format `<genre>-<block>-<line>`, where `genre` identifies the genre (`news` or `gov`); `block` is a unit annotated by the same set of annotators; `line` is the line number in the block.
- `sentence_num` is the sentence number in the sequence to which the sentence belongs. This is useful when you want to know where each sequence starts or ends.
- `sentence` is the sentence itself segmented int SUWs (denoted with `|`).

The subsequent `<word_i>` lines provide information about each word in the sentence in the format `<word>\t<position>\t<ignore>\t<easy>\t<not_easy>\t<diff>\t<very_diff>\t<complexity>`:

- `position` consists of the start and end offsets of the word separated with a colon.
- `ignore` contains `P` or `Q` when the word should be ignored. Specifically, `P` means that the word is a proper noun; `S` means that an error related to segmentation occurred in the word.
- `easy`, `not_easy`, `diff`, and `very_diff` are the numbers of annotators who assigned the respective label to the word.
- `complexity` is the complexity score of the word for the L1 group.

When the word is to be ignored, the fields `easy`, `not_easy`, `diff`, `very_diff`, and `complexity` each contain `-`.

## Cross-Validation Splits

The file `cv_splits.json` contains cross-validation splits that we have used for experiment in the paper [TODO add reference], and which can therefore serve to replicate it, or easily compare our results with other systems.

We have used:
- 5 folds,
- stratification by genre (News and Government),
- grouping by sequence of sentences (see Section 3 in the paper).

Genres are thus equally represented in each fold, and a sequence of sentences is never split between a training set and a validation set.

The `cv_splits.json` file has the following form:

```
[
	[split1_train, split1_validation],
	[split2_train, split2_validation],
	[split3_train, split3_validation],
	[split4_train, split4_validation],
	[split5_train, split5_validation]
]
```

Each split's training or validation set is a list of IDs (first tab-separated fields of the sentence lines in the dataset files).
